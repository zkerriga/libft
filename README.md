# libft
<h3>A library of useful functions in the C language.</h3>

In it, I tried to repeat the work of <i>standard functions</i> and wrote my <i>own functions</i> for working with:
1. Strings
2. Memory
3. Numbers
4. Related lists

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

In the root directory of the repository, you must specify the command `make` .
The <i>static</i> library will be compiled.
